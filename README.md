## Installing required libraries

For most work with sensors, you need to install `Adafruit` library.  In the Arduino IDE, you go to Manage Libraries:

then choose the library **Adafruit Unified Sensors** which you can install:

You may need other libraries which you may find in the Library Manager, or in the Arduino Libraries folder for the [bootcamp](https://drive.google.com/open?id=18GHKEBaW2cN3h2tDedXozpFqsq8FvtFG).
