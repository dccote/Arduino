# Otto the robot

[Otto](https://www.ottodiy.com) is a robot for kids you can build with an Arduino Nano, a Nano I/O shield, motors and a range finder. The kit can be bought in stores or on the web.

Since there is a significant amount of examples, it can be used to understand motors and the range finder.
